## ADR-20260530-001: Strict TypeScript Compilation Standards for Release

### Context
Strict TypeScript unused parameter rules (`noUnusedParameters: true` in `tsconfig.json`) cause package builds to fail when interface implementations define unused arguments for generic compatibility. In this case, `runtime/kain` defined `response: string` in its main analysis hook, which was never read, causing full monorepo build failures.

### Decision
Prefix all unused, interface-required function arguments in `@iskra/` and `runtime/` packages with an underscore `_` (e.g. `_response: string`). This signals to TypeScript that the argument is intentionally unused for interface compatibility, resolving compilation blockages without sacrificing strict safety settings.

### Alternatives
- **Disable strict unused checks:** Highly discouraged as it reduces overall code quality and security boundaries.
- **Remove unused parameter entirely:** Impossible for generic callback hooks where third-party libraries require a fixed function signature.

### Consequences
- **Pros:** Successful recursive package builds, clean compilation output, and robust monorepo releases.
- **Cons:** Minor code syntax adjustments required during API design.

### Verification
- Ran `pnpm build` in workspace root. Verification passed successfully (built in 4.04s).
