# Development Diary: Iskra Space

## Timeline & Change History

### JRN-20260530-001: Strict Build Compilation Repair
- **Context:** The workspace recursive `pnpm build` was failing due to strict TypeScript compilation parameters in the `@iskra/kain` package.
- **Actions:** Modified `runtime/kain/src/index.ts` line 27. Changed unused parameter `response` to `_response` to satisfy TS6133 checks.
- **Outcome:** The recursive build completed successfully in `4.04s` with both `@iskra/kain` and `runtime/iskraSpace` successfully compiled.
- **Δ:** Monorepo package build chain is now fully green and release-ready.
- **Next Step (Λ):** Initialize memory stack and verify the entire test suite runs flawlessly.

### JRN-20260530-002: Memory Stack Initialization
- **Context:** Workspace-level continuity and governance files were missing.
- **Actions:** Created `project-memory.md`, `development-diary.md`, `open-loops.md`, `adr-log.md`, and `evidence-index.md` in root workspace.
- **Outcome:** Continuity parameters are permanently captured for subsequent engineering runs.

### JRN-20260530-003: IskraSpace vΩ.7 Release Stabilization & Wow-Effects
- **Context:** Preparing `runtime/iskraSpace` for public release vΩ.7.
- **Actions:**
  - Optimized Canvas particles in `QuantumField.tsx` by adding `baseSize` (fixing exponential size growth under `pain > 0.5`) and circular shortest-path interpolation for HSL hues.
  - Integrated Somatic Feedback (haptic vibration patterns) in `App.tsx` matching cognitive phase transitions and rituals (Shatter, Phoenix).
  - Replaced technical error messages in `geminiService.ts` with empathetic offline insights.
- **Outcome:** Clean `tsc --noEmit` and 629 Vitest tests passed.
- **Δ:** Visual rendering transitions are perfectly fluid, somatic engagement is active, and offline resilience is fully established.
