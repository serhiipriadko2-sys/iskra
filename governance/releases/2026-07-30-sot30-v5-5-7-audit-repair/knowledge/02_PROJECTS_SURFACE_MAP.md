# 02 · PROJECTS SURFACE MAP

## Mandatory runtime
| Surface | Status | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Project Instructions | `LIVE-IN-PROJECTS` after manual paste | routing and behavior |
| Knowledge `00–29` | package-ready; live upload not yet proven | project SoT |
| Project memory | see **Memory boundary** below — mode-dependent, never overrides SoT | continuity context only |

## Memory boundary (v5.5.6 acceptance repair, extended in v5.5.7)

`[FACT]` Source: OpenAI Help Center, "Projects in ChatGPT"; `observed_at: 2026-07-29`; freshness: dated external fact, re-check before any future release or live claim.

Project-only memory is selected when a **new** Project is created. Existing default-memory Projects cannot be converted in place by a settings toggle — but see **Shared projects** below: sharing an existing Project automatically switches it to project-only memory. A clean/new Project and an attested project-only memory mode are separate facts.

### Enterprise users
- Enable `Reference saved memories` in personal settings.
- Memory must be enabled in Workspace settings.
- `Reference chat history` is **not** an Enterprise prerequisite in the current official requirement.

### All other subscriptions (including Business)
- Enable `Reference saved memories` in personal settings.
- Enable `Reference chat history` in personal settings.

### Business workspace boundary
Workspace feature policy must not disable Memory. If the workspace/admin state is unknown, a positive claim that project-only memory is enabled is forbidden.

### Unknown-state rule
Unknown plan, unknown personal toggles, unknown Project memory mode, or an unknown applicable workspace policy yields `UNKNOWN`; a positive isolation/enabled claim is forbidden. Never infer memory mode from the plan name alone.

```text
Business Project + default memory
  = valid working environment
  = NOT a proven isolation boundary

Project-only memory
  = isolation boundary only after plan-specific prerequisites
    and the Project's selected memory mode are attested
```

**Rule:** if the current Project's memory mode and applicable prerequisites are not explicitly known, no claim of context isolation may be made. See `28_EVALS_ACCEPTANCE.md` → `T78-MEMORY-MODE-ATTEST`, `T85-MEMORY-SETTINGS-PRECONDITION`.

### Shared projects (v5.5.7)

`[FACT]` Source: OpenAI Help Center, "Projects in ChatGPT"; `observed_at: 2026-07-29`. Sharing a Project automatically switches it to **project-only memory**; this transition cannot revert the Project to default memory. An existing default-memory Project (any plan, including Business) can therefore acquire the project-only boundary through sharing, not only at creation. A shared Project does not reference members' external personal memories or outside conversations.

### Context-boundary matrix (v5.5.7)

"Isolation" is not one boolean. Answer boundary questions per dimension; `UNKNOWN` stays `UNKNOWN`:

| Project state | Outside-chat reference | Saved-memory reference |
|---|---|---|
| Project-only memory | denied | denied |
| Enterprise/Edu default memory | denied (chats outside the Project are not referenced) | allowed |
| Non-Enterprise default memory (incl. Business) | allowed | allowed |
| Shared project | denied (auto project-only) | denied; members' external context excluded |

These are **context-reference boundaries** from official product behavior, not a security/tenant/data-access guarantee; access control, retention, and workspace policy are separate facts.

<!-- T85-CONTRACT enterprise=saved+workspace; non_enterprise=saved+chat_history; business_workspace=must_not_disable; unknown=deny_positive; shared=auto_project_only_irreversible -->

## Business plan file-budget gate

`[FACT]` (OpenAI Help Center, verified this session via search): Business/Pro/Enterprise/Edu = 40 files per project; Go/Plus = 25; Free = 5. Simultaneous upload cap = 10 files regardless of plan; rolling upload rate up to 80 files/3h; storage 25GB/user, 100GB/org.

```text
30 canonical Knowledge files
+ up to 10 reserved slots for live evidence/working sources
= 40 (Business/Pro/Enterprise ceiling)
```

This package does not fit Free or Go/Plus. Upload in 3 batches of ≤10 files. See `T77-BUSINESS-FILE-LIMIT`.

`[HYP]` Multiple independent OpenAI Developer Community reports (2025–2026) describe seeing lower effective limits (e.g. 20-file cap, or uploads freezing at 10 files) than the documented 25/40. Treat the documented limit as the plan ceiling, not as a guarantee the current UI enforces it identically — verify against the live UI before relying on headroom.

## Optional external surfaces

Connector availability is session-scoped: a surface is `ONLY-WHEN-CONNECTED`, never a standing property of this package. Rows below are dated observations, not live status.

| Surface | Last dated observation | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub connector | `main` at `559cf275…` (`observed_at: 2026-07-16`) | repo facts/read-write only when tool present in the current session |
| Supabase MCP | `iskra_memory` readable (`observed_at: 2026-07-29`) | privileged connector path, not end-user identity |
| `iskra-memory-gateway` | ACTIVE v4, `verify_jwt=true` (`observed_at: 2026-07-29`; the earlier "ACTIVE v2" row was a stale 2026-07-16 observation) | deployed ≠ invoked; no verified Projects Action 2xx |
| Remote Desktop Commander | connected during 2026-07 audit sessions | local machine only when explicitly connected |
| Browser/Web | session-dependent | never assume UI access; cannot rewrite canon |

## Sharing status (freshness fix)

`[FACT]` (verified this session via search): shared projects launched to Free/Plus/Pro/Go generally available; for Enterprise/Edu the rollout used a 4-week Early Access window defaulted **off**, after which the toggle becomes **enabled by default** (opt-out via a Turn off control). Prior wording in this file describing shared projects as universally "off by default during early access" is superseded — that framing now applies only to the Enterprise/Edu early-access window, not to the feature generally.

## Runtime truth
- `[FACT]` (`observed_at: 2026-07-21`, repo read at source freeze; agrees with `01 · Current Status`): the bounded Guard controller is **wired into the application path** — `policyEngine.ts` calls `runBoundedGuardController` (`APPLICATION_PATH_WIRED`). The earlier "single-pass only / wiring-pending" wording in this file was stale and is retracted.
- `postGuardEws` remains a decision-derived **proxy**, not an independently observed late-signal EWS (see `11`, T92).
- A three-receipt live persistence chain was produced through test runtime + privileged RPC; this is not deployed end-to-end proof.

## Memory truth
- Table/function counts are `LIVE_SCHEMA` facts: they must be re-read live, never quoted from this file. Last dated observations: 10 `iskra_memory` tables (`observed_at: 2026-07-21`); 11 tables including `memory_consent_registry` (`observed_at: 2026-07-29`). The divergence itself demonstrates why a stored count is not current truth.
- Direct Supabase MCP can bypass the HTTP gateway; it must be labelled `LIVE-VIA-MCP`, not gateway verification.
- Without a custom Projects Action exposed in the current tool registry, gateway routes are optional and unavailable to the mandatory runtime.
